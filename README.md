## **Friendface is an app meant to take in user input and match friends based on responses given**

## **Link to Heroku deployed site: https://murmuring-temple-12556.herokuapp.com/**
### **Home page**
     * The home page is basic and mostly works as a link to the survey so users can add their information

### **Survey**
     * The user manually enters two fields:
        * Name
        * photo
     * The user then chooses between 1-5 responding to questions
        * 1 expresses that they disagree while 5 is strongly agree
     * The user submits the information, it is sent to the friends.js file
### **Enhancements**
     * The response from the user will be used to compare with other users and tell them if their answers match with another user and they should be friends
